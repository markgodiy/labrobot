- How to Send Waypoints to the ROS 2 Navigation Stack â€“ Nav 2  
https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-send-waypoints-to-the-ros-2-navigation-stack-nav-2/  
**Summary:** This tutorial explains how to send waypoints to a mobile robot using the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2) with Python. It covers real-world applications (e.g., delivery, hospitals, restaurants), prerequisites (ROS 2, Python 3.7+, workspace setup), and step-by-step directions. The guide includes creating Python scripts (`waypoint_follower.py`, `robot_navigator.py`), setting up launch and parameter files, and running the robot in simulation. The robot follows a sequence of waypoints, and the tutorial provides code snippets, configuration tips, and troubleshooting advice for successful navigation in Gazebo simulation environments.
